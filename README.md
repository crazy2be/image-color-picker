HTML5 Image Color Picker
========================

As a developer, I have recently been working a theme for mobile web apps, given to me by our excellect design team. Much of the process involved is looking at the image, zooming in on a particular aspect, finding the color used for a particular component, and translating it all into code.

Surprisingly, I could not find a tool that allowed me to do this well. While a full-blown image editor, such as GIMP, allows me to do these things, it has so much chrome in the way that I can't just focus on the design itself. What I really wanted was an image viewer with a color picker built in, and no satisfactory tool existed. Some allowed me to pick a color, but with no zooming or panning, and a poor interface and lots of wasted space.

So here is my quick, hacked together solution. It does what I need, and it does it quite well. Hopefully it's existance will save you the 5 hours it took to write, and perhaps even give you a chance to improve upon it.
